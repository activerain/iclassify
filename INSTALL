Installing iClassify
--------------------

Prerequisites
-------------
iClassify is still pretty early in it's life, so installation is not exactly
a piece of cake.  You need a few prerequisites:

1. uuidtools. (http://sporkmonger.com/projects/uuidtools/)
   You can install this with "gem install uuidtools"
   
2. Rails.
   You can install this with "gem install rails"
   
3. SQLite 3 (http://www.sqlite.org)
   Assuming you already have the libraries, a "gem install sqlite3-ruby" 
   will do the trick.

4. Facter. (http://reductivelabs.com/projects/facter/)
   iClassify uses Facter to populate lots of useful information about the
   operating system.  You probably already have facter, since iClassify 
   without Puppet at this not super useful.

5. Builder. (http://builder.rubyforge.org)
   Builder is for generating XML.  "gem install builder". 
   
6. Ferret and acts_as_ferret.
   Ferret is a full text search engine.  Install the latest ferret from
   gems, and then install the acts_as_ferret from trunk with:
   
   script/plugin install svn://projects.jkraemer.net/acts_as_ferret/trunk/plugin/acts_as_ferret

Instructions for the iClassify Service
--------------------------------------

Checkout iClassify

  $ git clone git://hjksolutions.com/iclassify iclassify

Move the new directory to the location you want to serve it from.

  $ sudo mv iclassify /srv/iclassify
  
Create the log directory.
 
  $ sudo mkdir /srv/iclassify/log

Change to that directory, and create the database.

  $ RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
  
Start iClassify.

  $ ./script/server -e production
  
You can now hit port 3000 on your host to see the iClassify interface.
Getting things running under a proper rails style deployment will eventually
show up as a puppet recipe, but for now, it's left as an exercise to the
user.

------------------------
Instructions for icagent
------------------------

The icagent provides for a simple mechanism to have systems register 
themselves with iClassify.  You should install it on your systems, by
doing:

  $ mkdir /srv/icagent
  $ cd /srv/iclassify
  $ cp -ra ./lib /srv/icagent
  $ cp -ra ./icagent /srv/icagent
  $ cp -ra ./bin /srv/icagent
  
And then distributing the resulting set to your hosts, setting up a cronjob,
and calling it a day.  You call icagent by:

  $ icagent -s http://yourserver:3000 -d /srv/icagent/icagent
  
This will register your host as unclassified, with all the attributes from
Facter present.

------------------
Puppet Integration
------------------

Assuming you are running iClassify on the same system as your puppet master,
you can use iClassify as your external node tool.  Tags in iClassify equate
to classes in Puppet.   To do so, you should set:

[main]
  external_nodes = "/srv/iclassify/bin/icpuppet"
  
Puppet has a bug currently that prevents setting command line arguments on
the external_nodes call.  This should be fixed soon, but until then, you
need to either crack open icpuppet and hard code the server path or just
run it on the same host.

-------------------
Command line search
-------------------

It's neat to be able to search from the command line.  Poke around at the
icsearch command, and you can easily start building shell scripts to do
good things.
